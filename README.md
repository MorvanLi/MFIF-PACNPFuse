An Interpretable Self-Adaptive Coupled Neural P System for Multi-focus Image Fusion



## Abstract

Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing, with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise boundaries. However, images generated by imaging systems are often characterized by noise, and existing artificial neural network methods lack interpretable working mechanisms, leading to inaccurate generated decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce bio-inspired parameter self-adaptive coupled neural P (PACNP) systems, which are 3rd-generation neural computation models inspired by spiking neuron mechanisms, to enhance the accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first thoroughly study the neurodynamic behavior of the model neurons, facilitating parameter adaptation to avoid model failure. Then, we propose a novel approach called PACNPFuse for MFIF based on PACNP systems. Unlike current ideas of decision map generation, PACNPFuse distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike matrices. In addition, the inherent discrete nature of spikes effectively suppresses noise interference. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be generated directly without any post-processing. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method outperforms 15 state-of-the-art MFIF methods in visual and quantitative performance. Moreover, PACNPFuse is able to significantly improve the performance of downstream tasks such as salient target detection. The code for PACNPFuse is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/MFIF-PACNPFuse.

## Implementation Details
The traditional methods run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-13400 CPU, and the DL methods run on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. We set the coupling radius $r$ of PACNPFuse to be 16 and the number of iterations $t$ to be 110.



## Note
We did not upload the experimental results data of all the comparison methods because they were too large. If any researcher needs the results of these comparison methods, please contact me via email: morvanli@stu.xjtu.edu.cn.
